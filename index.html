        The Valmiki Research Centre (VRC) regards the Ramayana, composed by the
        great sage Valmiki, as an invaluable treasure of humanity — one of the
        world’s most ancient and timeless epics. Beyond religious origins, it
        offers universal insights into ethics, leadership, duty, and spiritual
        wisdom.
