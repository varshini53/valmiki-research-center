        <h2>A Place Where the Ramayana Lives</h2>

        <p>
          The Valmiki Research Centre (VRC) regards the Ramayana, composed by the
          great sage Valmiki, as an invaluable treasure of humanity—one of the
          world’s most ancient and timeless epics. Beyond religious origins,
          the Ramayana transcends cultural and geographical boundaries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ramanarayanam, the spiritual theme park, is spread across 15 acres on
          Korukonda Road in Vizianagaram district, Andhra Pradesh, approximately
          50 km from Visakhapatnam airport. It attracts devotees and visitors
          from across the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The complex artistically presents 72 pivotal Ramayana episodes through
          sculptures, supported by bilingual subtitles, audio guides, and
          explanatory content. Temples, meditation centres, a cultural library,
          and themed tree groves together offer a holistic spiritual journey.
